Vedant wants to buy some Somaiya sheets but he is short of pocket money! The
Somaiya sheets costs C Rupees.<br><br>
Vedant has a magical piggy bank. He soon discovered that he could put some money
into it each morning and in the dark of the night the money contained in the piggy bank
would become X times. He could deposit any amount of money on any day. He might
not deposit any money on some days. Regardless of all this the money in the piggy bank
would become X times every night.<br><br>
Now Vedant wants to deposit the least possible total sum of money into the piggy bank
and obtain C Rupees. Being the good boy Vedant is, he doesn't aspire for anything more
and hence needs exactly C Rupees when he breaks the piggy bank on some afternoon.
Note that the number of days he puts money or when he breaks the piggy bank is not
required to be minimised.<br><br>
