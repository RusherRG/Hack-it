<p>Ciel's restaurant, a waiter is training.
Since the waiter isn't good at arithmetic, sometimes he gives guests wrong change.
Ciel gives him a simple problem.
What is <b>A-B </b>(<b>A</b> minus <b>B</b> )?

Surprisingly, his answer is wrong. To be more precise, his answer has exactly one wrong digit. Can you imagine this? Can you make the same mistake in this problem? </p>
